To edit user stories send a PUT or a PATCH specifying the user story id in the url.
In a PATCH request you just need to send the modified data, in a PUT one the whole object must be sent.

[source,bash]

curl -X PATCH \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ1c2VyX2F1dGhlbnRpY2F0aW9uX2lkIjoyfQ:1Xmdha:b8FZ8GdrDYmbdSBs1aDM2Ts35sg" \
  -d '{
          "subject": "Patching subject"
      }' \
