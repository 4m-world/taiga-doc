To edit user story attachments send a PUT or a PATCH specifying the user story attachment id in the url.
In a PATCH request you just need to send the modified data, in a PUT one the whole object must be sent.

[source,bash]

curl -X PATCH \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ1c2VyX2F1dGhlbnRpY2F0aW9uX2lkIjoyfQ:1Xmdha:b8FZ8GdrDYmbdSBs1aDM2Ts35sg" \
  -F "description=patching description" \

When the creation is successful, the HTTP response is a 200 OK and the response body is a JSON link:#object-attachment-detail[attachment detail object]
