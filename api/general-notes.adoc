=== Authentication
To authenticate requests an http header called "Authorization" should be added. Its format should be:

[source]
----
Authorization: Bearer ${AUTH_TOKEN}
----

This token can be received through the link:#auth-normal-login[login API ]

=== Pagination
By default the API will always return paginated results and includes the following headers in the response:

- x-paginated: boolean indicating if pagination is being used for the request
- x-paginated-by: number of results per page
- x-pagination-count: total number of results
- x-pagination-current: current page
- x-Pagination-Next: next results
- x-Pagination-Prev: previous results

*Disabling pagination* can be accomplished by setting an extra http header:

[source]
----
x-disable-pagination: True
----
