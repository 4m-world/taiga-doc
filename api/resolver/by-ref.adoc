To resolve an object if we don't know its type we have to use `ref` GET parameter:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X GET \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  https://api.taiga.io/api/v1/resolver?project=taiga\&ref=915
----

The response body is a JSON object containing the project and the story, task or
issue id.

[source,json]
----
{
    "project": 1,
    "task": 1336
}
----

[IMPORTANT]
.Incompatibility between GET params
=====================================================================
Be careful because `ref` is inconpatible with `us`, `task` and `issue`
parameters in requests with multiple resolutions.
