Introduction
------------

Your Agile, Free and Open Source Project Management Tool


Project Maturity
----------------

Since _taiga_ is a young project it is currently in alpha state.


How it works
------------

Taiga is composed mainly by two components: link:https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-front[taiga-front]
and link:https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-back[taiga-back]

- *taiga-front* has the front related code and it is done using *angularjs* and *coffescript*.
  It can runs on any static file server like nginx.
- *taiga-back* has the backend related code and it consists in an api, done using *django*
  and *python3*.

Obviously, taiga has other modules, but they are optional and documented in other sections.

How to contribute
-----------------

As an open source project, *taiga* welcomes contributions of many forms.

Examples of contributions include:

- Code patches.
- Documentation improvements.
- Bug reports.
- Patch reviews.

Before start developing one big feature (with intentions of including it on taiga code base), it is
strongly recommended chat about it using our link:http://groups.google.com/d/forum/taigaio[mailing list].

Reporting bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Otherwise, before reporting a bug or requesting a new feature, please consider these general points:

- Check that someone hasn't already filed the bug or feature request by searching or running custom queries in the ticket tracker.
- Check the right repository to use for report a issue: bugs related to UI should be go to *taiga-front*, if something happens on backend, the issue should be opened on *taiga-back* repository.
- Do ask on link:http://groups.google.com/d/forum/taigaio[mailing list] first if you're not sure if what you're seeing is a bug.
- Don't use the github issues system to ask support questions. Use the link:http://groups.google.com/d/forum/taigaio[mailing list] for that.
- Donâ€™t use the github issues for lengthy discussions, because they're likely to get lost. If a particular ticket is controversial, please move the discussion to the link:http://groups.google.com/d/forum/taigaio[mailing list].
