Your Agile, Free and Open Source Project Management Tool


Project Maturity
----------------

Since _taiga_ is a young project it is currently in alpha state.


How it works
------------

Taiga is composed mainly by two components: link:https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-front[taiga-front]
and link:https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-back[taiga-back]

- *taiga-front* has the front related code and it is done using *angularjs* and *coffescript*.
  It can runs on any static file server like nginx.
- *taiga-back* has the backend related code and it consists in an api, done using *django*
  and *python3*.

Obviously, taiga has other modules, but they are optional and documented in other sections.
