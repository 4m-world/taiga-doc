Setup using **taiga-scripts**
-----------------------------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**taiga-scrips** follows mainly the standard installation process, but makes it more automatic. If
something wrong happens in the process, should try fix them following the manual deploy process.

**taiga-scripts** always installs a concrete (last) version of taiga (taiga-front and taiga-back)


Important notes about using **taiga-scripts**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Is in alpha state. Not heavy tested in differents environments
- Designed for work with taiga-vagrant (see next section of this documentation)
- Not supports reprovisioning (updating) at this moment, it still in development.
- Does not supports installation with root user.
- The installation is not 100% ready for production.


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fresh installed and updated Ubuntu 14.04
- Bash shell
- Git


Setup server-like environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Having fresh and updated ubuntu 14.04 machine or virtual image:

[source, txt]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-scripts.git
$ cd taiga-scripts
$ bash setup-server.sh
----


Setup development-like environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This setup is much like the previous but with a few differences:

- Do not install services like nginx, because they are only necessary for production
- Set all hostnames to localhost to easily run everything on localhost

Having fresh and updated ubuntu 14.04 machine or virtual image:

[source, txt]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-scripts.git
$ cd taiga-scripts
$ bash setup-devel.sh
----
