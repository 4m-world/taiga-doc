How to upgrade Taiga
====================
:toc: left

The Taiga platform is developed on github. For consistences you should alway maintain the same version
in time with the *stable* branch of git or use the last major version of each component.

**No packaged version of Taiga is available at this moment.**

.Frontend application
[source,bash]
----
cd ~/taiga-front-dist
git checkout stable
git pull
----

.Backend application
----
As user "taiga" or whatever user you use, do not run this code as "root" to avoid errors.
cd ~/taiga-back
git checkout stable
workon taiga
git pull
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate --noinput
python manage.py compilemessages
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
circusctl reload taiga

In case taiga-celery is configured reload it too:

[source,bash]

circusctl reload taiga-celery
